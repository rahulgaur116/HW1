## Rahul Sharma Challenge 1- Submission

Purpose of this project is to update an existing code to meet following webpage requirements.

## User Story
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## Mock-Up
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)


I made upates to the existing index html file and css styling file to implement above requirements.

1.  Firstly I changed the varous repetetive "div" section to make the code follow a semantic html. 

2. "div" for the First section of the code inside body element was renamed to header

3. As the elements within the header class included some click on text, those section "div" was renamed to "nav"

4. Any section containing an image, the "div" was renamed to "figure"

5. Additional "div" element were renmaed/chnaged to "article" "section" to furthur improve the html file semantic.
